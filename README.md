# Text-cryptor
This is litterally nothing more than a quick way to pass secret notes online, because I'm using such a small section of the password hash for this dont expect it to beat the NSA, but honestly I think its prety good so feel free to use as you see fit. 

The whole top bit is kinda long winded so that it will work slightly better from cli and stuff. The shortened version is at the bottom.

email me if you have any issues: [joshua.himmens@gmail.com](mailto:joshua.himmens@gmail.com)

P.S. I actually think this might be decently secure. (if you think cryptography.fernet is secure)
