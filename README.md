# Text-cryptor
This is litterally nothing more than a quick way to pass secret notes online, because I'm using such a small section of the password hash for this dont expect it to beat the NSA, but honestly I think its prety good so feel free to use as you see fit. 

email me if you have any issues: [joshua.himmens@gmail.com](mailto:joshua.himmens@gmail.com)

P.S. I actually think this might be decently secure. (if you think cryptography.fernet is secure)
